# Chatbot 

## Overview

The chatbot module of our financial dashboard project serves as an interactive interface for users to engage with financial data powered by OpenAI's GPT models, this chatbot leverages the latest in AI to provide insights, data analysis, and answers to user queries about financial metrics and company performances. This document outlines the structure and functionality of the chatbot application, highlighting key components and their interactions.

## Key Components

### Main Chat Application

- **`main.py`**: The entry point of the chat application, integrating Streamlit for UI, handling API key management, user session initialization, and rendering the chat interface.

### API Key Management

- **`ApiKeyManager`**: Manages OpenAI API key validation, storage, and user prompts, ensuring secure and authenticated access to GPT models for generating chat responses.
  * security with the following measures:
    * Transient Use: Your API key is **only used for the duration of your session** to authenticate requests to OpenAI. It is not stored or logged, ensuring your key remains confidential and is discarded once your session ends. 
    * Encrypted Communication: All interactions, including API key transmission, occur over HTTPS, encrypting your data to prevent unauthorized access during transit. 
    * User-Controlled Security: We encourage the use of environment variables for API key management, especially for advanced users deploying this application, to avoid direct input into the web interface and further enhance security.
    
### Session and Chat Management

- **`initialize_session_state`**, **`handle_user_input`**, **`display_chat_messages`**: These functions collectively manage the chat session, user input processing, and the display of chat messages within the Streamlit application.

### Data Loader and Query Engine

- **`DataLoader`**: Handles data retrieval, filtering, and preparation for queries based on user-selected CIK numbers and financial metrics.
- **`generate_response`**: Utilizes a query engine to process user queries and generate responses using OpenAI's GPT models.

## Development Process

### Setting Up the Chatbot

1. **API Key Configuration**: Users are prompted to enter their OpenAI API key upon first accessing the chatbot. The `ApiKeyManager` securely stores and validates the key for subsequent sessions.

2. **Session Initialization**: The chat session is initialized with a welcoming message, and the `initialize_session_state` function prepares the session for user interactions.

3. **Handling User Queries**: User inputs are processed through `handle_user_input`, which invokes the query engine to generate and display responses.

### Extending the Chatbot

To enhance or customize the chatbot's functionality:

1. **Integrate New Data Sources**: Modify the `DataLoader` to include additional financial datasets or metrics for analysis.

2. **Customize Chat Responses**: Adjust the `generate_response` logic to include custom processing or formatting of chat responses based on specific user queries or data insights.
