The App Module
==============

The `app` module is the core of YourProject, encapsulating both the front-end (`gallery`) and back-end (`services`) components. Here, you'll find detailed documentation on the structure, functionalities, and how each part contributes to the overall application.

Front-end (Gallery)
-------------------

The front-end part of the application, known as `gallery`, focuses on the user interface and experience. It includes Streamlit applications, components, and utilities designed for interaction with the analysis tools.
